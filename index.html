				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<p>Undergraduate at Hartwick College studying Computer Science while minoring in Mathematics. I'm primarily interested in Machine Learning and have chosen to pursue my education
					outside of my course requirements. Through Coursera I completed Dr. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class, using Octave, offered by Stanford University, which covered such topics as Linear
					and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Unsupervised Learning, etc... Going on to complete MIT 6.S191 over the JTerm duration for Hartwick College. I elected
					to study this on my own as an independent study, reporting to my professors my lecture notes and lab work. This course opened my eyes the the breadth of DL (NNs, RNNs, CNNs, RL, and
					the like, on both NLP and CV) and since I have refined my studies primarily to NLP. My thesis, Disaster classification of tweets, is an NLP project that is centered around a dataset of over 10,000 tweets.
					In May, 2021 I will present my work in the form of a thesis defense to my department.
